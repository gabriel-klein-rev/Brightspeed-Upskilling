## Instructions

In this repository, you will find content for SQL, Bigquery, and PowerBI. Some of the content will be notes that guide you through content and implementation of certain topics, while some other content will be tutorials found in the documentation of the technologies (mainly Bigquery and PowerBI). Your job will to be to review these materials and, if possible, follow through the implementation using your own resources.

### SQL

In the SQL folder, you will find notes organized by module, then my topic. All of the notes are contained in files titled "Cumulative.md". You should be able to preview the files on the GitHub UI, but any editor that lets you view markdown files will allow you to see the formatted notes.

### Bigquery

In the Bigqeury folder, you will find a markdown file with links to documentation for getting started with Bigquery. I will also link you to a nice tutorial that goes through the setup and practice with Bigquery.

### PowerBI

In the PowerBI folder, you will find a markdown file with links to documentation for getting started with PowerBI. There will also be a tutorial for using Power Automate, and a tutorial for connecting to Bigquery data, all from the official documentation.
